# Happiness-analysis

A feeling of happiness while self introspecting is the major reason we indulge in our hobbies and choose places to live.

This Dataset is based on a survey conducted where people rated different metrics of their city on a scale of 5 and answered if they are happy or unhappy.

The goal of this dataset is to understand the important factors that play a role in making the residents of a city more happy with their lives.
